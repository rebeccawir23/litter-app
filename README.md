# Intro Page + Menu Page

<p>-page colors under variables.scss, can be easily changed</p>
<p>-had issues centering vertically (was trying to use tables and grid rows but ionic was giving me problems), but got it to at least center horizontally</p>
<p>-Intro page in login folder</p>
<p>-Menu page in home folder</p>
<p>-assets folder contains image for the intro page (assets/img)</p>

<p>If you need anything else please let me know! :)</p>
