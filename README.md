-page colors under variables.scss, can be easily changed
-had issues centering vertically (was trying to use tables and grid rows but ionic was giving me problems), but got it to at least center horizontally
-Intro page in login folder
-Menu page in home folder
-assets folder contains image for the intro page (assets/img)
