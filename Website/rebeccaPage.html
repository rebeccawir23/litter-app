    <p>
		 My name is Rebecca Wirick. I am in my fourth year at Boise State and have one more year after this one. 
    I changed my major to GIMM last year from computer science and have been enjoying it ever since. I was born and 
    raised outside of Ft. Worth, Texas and moved to Boise to come to school. On campus I am involved in The student IMPACT Board as 
    the VP of Marketing so I plan on using the skills I learn this semester in WebDev to create a website for the organization. 
    I currently work at The Discovery Center of Idaho and really like the opportunity that I have through my job get kids excited 
    about STEM opportunities. Outside of school and work, I love to ski, hike, and watch football with friends. I am unsure about 
    my plans after graduation, but I think developing the technology we study into educational use, whether it be in classrooms or 
    training simulations is something I am interested in.
