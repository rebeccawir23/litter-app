    Hi, I’m Wendy. I’ve lived a lot of different lives: U.S. Marine, security administrator at JPL/NASA, programmer and graphic designer, operations/logistics director, and house cleaner. I don't have a lot of free time since I currently work ~30-hours a week, am taking 12 to 15 credits every semester and I also homeschool my middle-schooler. However, my time in the Marines showed me that getting upbetween 5-6am makes me a lot more productive (I highly recommend it!), so I try to squeeze in the following whenever I can: hand embroidery/knitting/sewing, reading a book a week, keeping up on foreign languages, writing a novel, working on my own video game, playing piano/composing, and working out.
    I am looking forward to working on AWS this semester and making an app that doesn’t use Xcode. I started using Dreamweaver when it was still owned by Macromedia but I haven’t used it in 5-6 years so that should be fun as well.
    After GIMM, I plan to take 4-5 years and finish the game that I am currently working on. After that, no clue. </div>
